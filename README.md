First techdegree project -- Numbers guessing game by Eugene Tkach

To run the program, in console type: python guessing_game.py

The game will greet the user and ask them to guess a number within the range of 1 and 10. If the guess in not numeric or is outside of the allowed range, the user will recieve a prompt. As the user enters guesses, they will be prompted whether their guess is higher or lower than the secret number. Once the guess is made correctly, the number of tries it took will be displayed. If the number of tries is less than the previous highscore, the user will be prompted that they now have a new highscore, otherwise it will prompt them of the current highscore and whether they tied it or did not beat it.

The user will then be asked if they would like to play again, if yes, a new number is generated, they're prompted what is the highscore to beat and the game repeats. If no, the game prompts the user thanking them for playing and exits the program.
